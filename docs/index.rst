Welcome to QNET's documentation!
================================

The QNET package is a set of tools to aid in the design and analysis of photonic circuit models, but it features a flexible symbolic algebra module that can be applied in a more general setting.

For a rigorous introduction to the underlying mathematical physics we refer to the original treatment of Gough and James [GoughJames08]_, [GoughJames09]_ and the references given therein.


This package is still work in progress and as it is currently being developed by a single developer (interested in `helping? <mailto:goerz@stanford.edu>`_), documentation and comprehensive testing code are still somewhat lacking.
Any contributions, bug reports and general feedback from end-users would be highly appreciated. If you have found a bug, it would be extremely helpful if you could try to write a minimal code example that reproduces the bug.
Feature requests will definitely be considered. Higher priority will be given to things that many people ask for and that can be implemented efficiently.
