Hideo Mabuchi had the initial idea for a software package that could exploit
the Gough-James SLH formalism to generate an overall open quantum system model
for a quantum feedback network based solely on its topology and the component
models in analytic form. The actual QNET package was then planned and
implemented by Nikolas Tezak. In the Fall of 2015 Michael Goerz joined as a
main developer.

Work on QNET was directly supported by DARPA-MTO under Award No.
N66001-11-1-4106. Nikolas Tezak was also supported by a Simons Foundation Math+X
fellowship as well as a Stanford Graduate Fellowship.
Michael Goerz was supported in part by ASD(R\&E) under their Quantum Science and
Engineering Program (QSEP), and by the Army High Performance Computing Research
Center (AHPCRC) (sponsored by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory under contract
No. W911NF-07-2-0027). Currently, Michael Goerz is sponsored by the Army
Research Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-16-2-0147.
